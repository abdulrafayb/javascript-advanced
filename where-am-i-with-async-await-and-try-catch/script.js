/* now if we want to fix this to be able to catch the error here then we'll have to rethrow that error which means to throw the error again so that we can then propogate it down, and with that we will manually reject a promise that's returned from the async function, there is still a problem however now we are mixing the old and new way of working with promises, so lets convert it to async/await as well and we can do that because we can treat the promise that was returned just like any other promise so we can handle it with async/await but the problem is that we can't use the await without the async function and we don't really want a new function here so instead we will use an IIFE, and this is also a use case for IIFE */
