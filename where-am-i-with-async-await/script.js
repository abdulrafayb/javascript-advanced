/* there is a better and easier way to consume promises with async/await, so we start by creating a special function which would be an async function and we do this by simply adding async keyword, with this the function becomes asynchronous function, a function that will keep running in the background while performing the code inside of it and when the funtion is donw it automatically returns a promise, and inside an async function we can have one or more await statements */

/* in an async function like below we can use the await keyword to basically wait for the result of the promise, await will stop the code execution at this point of the function until the promise is fulfilled meaning until the data has been fetched */

/* but stopping the code means blocking the execution, but in this case we are stopping the execution in an async function which is running asynchronously in the background therefore it is not blocking the main thread of execution meaning not blocking the call stack and that is what special about await, it makes our code look like regular synchronous code while behind the scenes everything is in fact asynchronous */
